### Abstract
Income prediction is a relatively undiscovered aspect of author profiling. Early research on English-speaking Twitter users linked to occupations and average incomes has been promising, but there is no comparable research for Dutch speakers yet. 

We want to find out to what extent profiling can predict the income level of Dutch-speaking Twitter users. We do so by applying the methodology as Flekova et al. (2016) at these users. Dutch-speaking users will be linked to their occupation and the average income for that occupation to establish ground truth and which stylometric features correlate significantly with income. 

Afterwards, we use these features to build a classifier, in order to find an answer to our research question.


### Python packages
* datagathering: tools used to download data from Twitter for our users and make a random selection of users.
* preprocessing: tools used to process the downloaded data into a suitable format for use with our classifier
* machinelearning: tools used to build the classifier that will predict income class for a given user.
